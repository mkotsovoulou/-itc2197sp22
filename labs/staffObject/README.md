# Lab 2: Using Objects in C++ and JAVA
This program requires the creation of a Staff Object, both in C++ and in JAVA using the following files:
c++: Staff.h and Staff.cpp
java: Staff.java

The object has the following attributes
* id, 
* name, and 
* department.

1. Create the code for the Constructor

2. Create setters and getters for all attributes
    * setId, 
    * setName, 
    * setDepartment, 
    * getId, 
    * getName, and 
    * getDepartment. 

3. Create a print function for C++ and a toString method in JAVA.
